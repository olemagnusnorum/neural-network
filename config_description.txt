Under the [globals] tag are variables that are for the network as a hole.
here is the globals variable that is a dictionary containing the the variables.
    'loss', 'lrate', 'wreg', 'wrt', 'verbose' and can contain 'wr' and 'br'.
    'loss' is the loss function of the network and can be 'mse' of 'cross_entropy'.
    'lrate' default learning rate and is a number.
    'wr' is a list [,] of the default range for the weight initialization for the layer.
    'br' is a list [,] of the default range for the bias initialization for the layer.
    'wreg' is the constant for the weight regularization and is a number.
    'wrt' is the weight regularization.
    'verbose' is the boolean for printing state values, and can be 'false' or 'true'.

Under the [layers] tag are for the differnt layers. each layer is a variable containing
a dictionary with the value 'size' 'act', 'lrate', 'wr', 'br'.
    'size' is the number of neurons in the layer.
    'act' is the activation function of the layer and can be 'sigmoid', 'relu', 'linear' or 'tanh'.
    'lrate' is learningrate for the layer.
    'wr' is a list [,] of the range for the weight initialization for the layer.
    'br' is a list [,] of the range for the bias initialization fir the layer.

Under the [data] tag are the values for data generation 'data' and 'images'.
'data' is a dictionary with the values 'number', 'size', 'split', 'noise', 
'object_height_range', 'object_width_range', 'centerd', 'flattend'.
    'number' is the size of the image.
    'split' is a list of the differnt splits [train,valid,test].
    'noise' is the precentage of noise in the image 0.xx.
    'object_height_range' is a list of the height range [,].
    'object_width_range' is a list of the width range [,].
    'centerd' is a boolean for if the image is to be centerd and has the values 'true' or 'false'.
    'flattend' is a boolean fo i the image is to be flattend and has the values 'true' or 'false'.
'images' is a dictionary that contains the key 'verbose' that can have the values 'true' or 'false'.
